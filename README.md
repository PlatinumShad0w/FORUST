# FORUST
An overhaul mod for Fallout: New Vegas

A fan mod for Fallout: New Vegas which completely overhauls much of the game's content to portray an alternate timeline set after the events of Dead Money if Elijah succeeds at his plan to use the toxic Cloud, security holograms, vending machines and linked explosive collars to conquer the Mojave. The overhaul changes the map into a horrifying totalitarian post-apocalyptic sandbox where the player's goal is to survive, resist and, perhaps, even discover a way to defeat Elijah and destroy the Sierra Madre once and for all.
